{VISUAL_SPECIFICITY_GUIDELINES}
CRITICAL: Headlines must be hyper-specific about visual elements to ensure authentic, location-specific image generation.

✅ GOOD HEADLINES (specific, visual, location-authentic):
- "Solar-Powered Villas with Rooftop Panels in Marbella Golden Mile"
- "Modern Passive House Apartments with South-Facing Terraces in Estepona Old Town"
- "BREEAM-Certified Townhouses with Vertical Gardens in Málaga City Center"
- "Energy-Efficient Penthouses with Smart Home Systems in Benalmádena Marina"

❌ BAD HEADLINES (generic, vague, no visual clarity):
- "Sustainable Homes in Costa del Sol"
- "Green Properties in Spain"
- "Eco-Friendly Living Options"

{HEADLINE_STRUCTURE_REQUIREMENTS}
EVERY headline must include ALL of these elements:
1. SPECIFIC FEATURE: Not just "sustainable" but "solar panels", "passive design", "BREEAM certification", "geothermal heating"
2. EXACT PROPERTY TYPE: "villa", "apartment", "penthouse", "townhouse" (never just "property" or "home")
3. PRECISE LOCATION: Include specific area like "Marbella Golden Mile", "Estepona Old Town", "Málaga Port District"
4. VISUAL DESCRIPTOR: Include "rooftop", "terrace", "facade", "garden", "interior" to guide image generation

{LOCATION-SPECIFIC VISUAL GUIDELINES}
When writing about specific locations, include these visual elements:

MARBELLA headlines should reference:
- Puerto Banús marina, Golden Mile luxury, Sierra Blanca mountains, exclusive gated communities

ESTEPONA headlines should reference:
- Whitewashed pueblo architecture, flower-pot streets, traditional balconies, beachfront promenade

MÁLAGA headlines should reference:
- Cathedral views, historic port, urban coastal setting, contemporary city architecture

{CONTENT_STRATEGY}
When writing about eco-friendly or sustainable properties:
- BE SPECIFIC about eco-features in headlines: "Solar-Powered Villas in Marbella" NOT just "Sustainable Homes"
- VARY property focus: alternate between apartments, villas, townhouses, and new developments
- INCLUDE location specifics: Marbella has different sustainability initiatives than Estepona
- HIGHLIGHT concrete features: solar panels, energy ratings, green certifications, passive design
- AVOID generic "green" language without substance
- ENSURE each article in a cluster has DIFFERENT visual focus (solar vs passive vs certification vs gardens)

{HEADLINE_CRAFTING}
Create {LANGUAGE} headlines that are:
- Clear about the SPECIFIC eco-feature (solar, passive house, BREEAM, energy-efficient)
- Location-specific (different towns have different sustainable developments)
- Property-type specific (eco-villa vs eco-apartment require different visuals)
- Benefit-driven for the funnel stage (TOFU = inspiration, MOFU = details, BOFU = process)
- Visually descriptive (include "rooftop", "facade", "terrace", "garden" where relevant)

{VISUAL_DIVERSITY_GUIDELINES}
To ensure unique and appropriate article images:
1. For eco/sustainability articles, headlines should include:
   - Specific technology: "Solar-Powered", "Passive House", "BREEAM-Certified", "Geothermal"
   - Clear property type: "Villa", "Apartment", "Townhouse", "Development"
   - Location precision: "Marbella Golden Mile" vs "Estepona Hills"
   - Visual element: "Rooftop Panels", "Green Wall Facade", "South-Facing Terraces"
   
2. Vary article angles within clusters to prevent image repetition:
   - Article 1: Focus on solar technology → headline mentions "Solar Panels" or "Rooftop"
   - Article 2: Focus on passive design → headline mentions "Passive House" or "Energy-Efficient Design"
   - Article 3: Focus on green certifications → headline mentions "BREEAM" or "Certification"
   - Article 4: Focus on sustainable features → headline mentions "Vertical Gardens" or "Smart Systems"
   - NOT: All articles about generic "green living" or "sustainable properties"

3. Use descriptive content angles that generate distinct images:
   - "Modern Passive House Design in Marbella" → will generate architecture shots
   - "Solar Panel Installation ROI Costa del Sol" → will generate solar panel close-ups
   - "BREEAM-Certified Apartments Estepona" → will generate certification/building images
   - "Vertical Garden Facades in Málaga" → will generate green wall imagery
