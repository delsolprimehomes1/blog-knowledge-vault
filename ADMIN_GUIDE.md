## Blog Funnel Strategy

### Understanding the Content Funnel

The blog uses a 3-stage funnel designed to guide users from awareness to conversion:

**TOFU (Top of Funnel)** - Shown on /blog index
- **Purpose**: Educational, broad awareness content
- **Target Audience**: Early-stage buyers researching the Costa del Sol
- **Content Type**: "What is...", "Why...", "Is..." questions
- **Examples**: "Is Costa del Sol a Digital Nomad's Paradise?"
- **Visibility**: Main blog index, sitemap, search results, social media
- **Word Count**: 1500-2000 words
- **CTA Strategy**: Link to 2-3 MOFU articles in related content section

**MOFU (Middle of Funnel)** - Hidden from blog index
- **Purpose**: Comparison guides, detailed how-to content
- **Target Audience**: Consideration stage buyers evaluating options
- **Content Type**: "How to compare...", "Which is better...", detailed comparisons
- **Examples**: "Comparing Internet Providers and Mobile Networks in Costa del Sol"
- **Visibility**: Direct URL, internal links from TOFU articles, sitemap, search results
- **Word Count**: 2000-2500 words
- **CTA Strategy**: Link to 1-2 BOFU articles in action-oriented section

**BOFU (Bottom of Funnel)** - Hidden from blog index
- **Purpose**: Action-oriented checklists, decision guides
- **Target Audience**: Decision stage buyers ready to take action
- **Content Type**: Checklists, step-by-step guides, implementation plans
- **Examples**: "Your Essential Checklist for Buying Property in Costa del Sol"
- **Visibility**: Direct URL, internal links from MOFU articles, sitemap, search results
- **Word Count**: 1000-1500 words
- **Special Feature**: Chatbot widget for immediate lead capture
- **CTA Strategy**: No outbound links - this is the conversion point

### Why This Funnel Strategy Works

**User Experience Benefits:**
- Reduces decision fatigue by showing only 3 entry-point articles on blog index
- Natural discovery path - users find MOFU/BOFU content through reading, not browsing
- Progressive disclosure of information complexity matches user intent

**Conversion Tracking:**
- Clear attribution - know which TOFU article drove each conversion
- Measurable funnel - track drop-off rates at each stage (TOFU ‚Üí MOFU ‚Üí BOFU)
- Content ROI - identify which topics generate highest quality leads

**SEO Advantages:**
- TOFU articles rank for broad, high-volume keywords
- MOFU/BOFU still indexed via sitemap and internal links
- Reduced keyword cannibalization - pages don't compete for same terms
- Internal linking signals funnel intent to search engines

**Content Scalability:**
- Can add 20+ MOFU/BOFU articles without overwhelming blog index
- Clear content planning framework for writers
- Easy to duplicate funnel structure across languages

### Funnel Best Practices

**Creating TOFU Content:**
- Answer broad awareness questions
- Use engaging, curiosity-driven headlines
- Include 3-5 H2 questions that address common concerns

- Answer "how to choose" and "which is better" questions
- Link to 1-2 BOFU articles at key decision points
- Target medium-volume, higher-intent keywords (100-500 monthly searches)

**Creating BOFU Content:**
- Focus on implementation and action
- Provide checklists, templates, step-by-step guides

- Enable chatbot widget for immediate engagement
- Target low-volume, high-intent long-tail keywords
